    <h1>About me </h1>
    <p>my name is Ashely, I am majoring in Biotechnology, I love spending time outside in all kinds of weather, My favorite season is autumn because that is when nature is the most beautiful. I enjoy learning new skills which is why I chose to take the csc 106 course, I also love traveling and trying different kinds of foods from difrent cultures, which is why my goal is to travel to more than 50 countries in the near future.</p>
